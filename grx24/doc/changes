	   a new sed script and the created dep-file should be
	   ok on any version GCC. Same change for Linux and X11
	   makefile. This change makes Watcom makefile creation
	   by utils/watmake work again.
	 Again fixed Watcom makefiles
	 Added -DGRX_DEFAULT_FONT_PATH="...." configuration for
	   default font path when no GRXFONT environment entry

	 GrImageStretch() now uses _GrFrDrvGenericStretchBlt()
98/04/30 Pascal definition for GrGetLibrarySystem
	 Changed VBE2 memory mapped IO support so a buggy BIOS
	   won't break the code that easily
98/04/28 Pattern filling uses predefined _GrPatternFiller instead
	   of local initialized var
	 S3 drivers banking functions enhanced
	 Unified DJGPP & Watcom VBE2 code
98/04/27 Fixed problems in font loading code on big endian systems
	 Updated Watcom support
	 Again eliminated some empty macro args
	 Added GrGetLibrarySystem() returning GRX_VERSION for

	 Fixed several portability problems, mainly removed cast
	   to (unsigned) int of assigned variables.
	 Fixed some bugs Thomas found in the ALPHA code
	 Changed temp. memory allocation. New function ALLOC()
	   will use malloc if SMALL_STACK defined of alloca otherwise.
	 Watcom assembler code didn't work. Changed the #pragma
	   definitions so they don't use macros.
	 Fixed several minor bugs
98/04/13 Fixed minor bugs in X11 driver.
98/04/06 Checked GNU-Pascal support (basic functions only)
98/04/05 Minor bugfixes and some GCC/386 speedups (copy & fill
	 loops aligned on 16byte boundary for optimal performance)
	 Changed the mouse timing information to real world time
	 instead of user process time (X11 & Linux)
	 GrMouseGetEventT will only return a valid ev.dtime if
	 any event occured
98/04/02 Faster VGA8X line drawing
	 The far (eg. to video ram) peek and poke operations
	 won't get optimized away any more (solves 4bpp blit bug)

	 Updated image support
98/03/19 24bpp mode changed:
	 - Added repfill_24 and optimized peek_24/poke_24
	 - dropped access24.h (only color component access left)
	 - LFB24 and RAM24 now use the same code.
	 - Optimization for black/grey/white filling: done by repfill_b
	 Fixed some Linux/386 shared lib problems (can't use EBX with -fPIC)
98/03/17 Major code rearrangement: (Watcom port may be broken :((
	 - A lot of frame driver now share code and use much
	   more optimized (!= generic) drawing functions
	 - Generic and asm fwdcopy/revcopy functions for blitting
	 - splitted header files to individual system files
	   (filling, copying, ...) for better maintaince and
	   easier optimization
	 - much work on BCC speed & stability
	 - Expect the Watcom port to be broken :((
