Welcome to the wonderful world of GRX for pascal-users.
=======================================================

If you are interested in GNU-Pascal (gpc), visit
http://home.pages.de/~gnu-pascal/
There is a mailinglist available.

This directory contains several test-programs for GRX
and GNU-Pascal.

* blt_test.pas draws some circles
* modetest.pas prints out the available modes
* taste.pas prints out the character-codes. Use "Q" to quit.
* txt_test.pas prints out some text. Press Return to exit.
* vir_test.pas lets you draw something.
  Press "1", to place some sqares with the mouse.
  Press "2" to draw some lines
  Press "3" to copy some drawings from one place to another
    ("<" and ">" change the size of your "copy-area")
  Press "4" to draw whatever you like :-)
  Press "0" to leave drawing-mode
  "Q" leaves vir_test.


To build up the programs, just edit the makefile and edit
the paths. You need to know, where your libtiff libjpeg is.

Then type
   make -f makefile all


Have fun!
